    <h1> What are IFS </h1>
    <p> IFS stands for interative function system. The system typically uses a linear transformation but I've also added serveral different function types</p>
    <p>The matrix contains the coefficents of the functions and in order to make the image, a function of the system is chosen at random and used to transform the point. At every iteration, the place where the point is is then drawn.</p>
    <p>This video from numberphile exlpains it quite well.</p>

    <h2> How to control </h2>
    <p>I would suggest first starting off by selecting and loading a preset. Then you can generate the IFS image. Then you can change part of the matrix and generate again to
      see how the changes to the matrix change the output image. By checking 'Auto generate', it will automatically genrate a new image everytime a parameter or part or the matrix changes.
    </p>
    <p>Enable checkbox next to each function is to enable it or remove it from being used in the system.<br> The percentage is to the right of each function is the liklihood of it being called. If the percentages sum to less than 100%, the last function in the system will take on the extra percentage. If the percentage sum goes past 100%, any of the functions after the 100% will have a 0% chance of being called.</p>
    <p>Serverside generation is meant for when you want to create larger photos and all of the computation is done on the server side.</p>
    <p>Scale is only used when serverside genration is used and it will scale down the image with bicubic scaling.</p>
